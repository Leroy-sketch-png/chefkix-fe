# Chefkix-FE: Session Workflow & State

This document is the single source of truth for our collaborative development session. It outlines our process and current objectives.

== Our Workflow ==

1.  **Roles**:
    *   **My Role (AI)**: I will proactively execute routine, repetitive, or time-consuming tasks, as well as tasks where you've already received guidance. I will always explain my actions and reasoning.
    *   **Your Role (User)**: You will focus on learning new concepts and performing new, unfamiliar tasks manually, with my step-by-step mentorship. You will provide high-level goals and review my work.

2.  **Pacing**:
    *   Complex steps are handled one-by-one.
    *   Simple, related commands are grouped to maintain pace.

3.  **Core Feature Cycle**:
    1.  **Branch**: Create a `feat/*` branch from `main`.
    2.  **Develop**: Write code for the feature.
    3.  **Test**: Manually test in the browser.
    4.  **Commit**: Save work with a Conventional Commit message.
    5.  **Merge**: Merge the feature branch back to `main`.
    6.  **Clean Up**: Delete the local feature branch.

4.  **Exceptions**:
    *   Minor doc changes can be committed directly to `main`.

== Current Project State ==

*   **Repo Status**: The `main` branch is up-to-date. All previous work is committed.
*   **Completed Features**:
    *   Professional project setup (quality gates, docs, structure).
    *   Mock Sign-In feature (service, UI, and logic).
    *   Mock Sign-Up feature (service, UI, and logic).
    *   GitHub Actions CI setup (workflow, automated checks, **type checking**, **unit testing**).
    *   **Pre-commit hook enhancements** (auto-staging formatted files).
    *   **Unit Testing** (Jest & React Testing Library setup, auth service tests).
    *   Zustand state management integration (auth store).
    *   shadcn/ui integration (setup, Button, Input, Form components).

== Your Immediate Task ==

We have successfully integrated unit testing into the project, covering the `auth` service with Jest and React Testing Library, and adding a test step to our CI pipeline.

What would you like to work on next? We could:
- Implement **Caching** for our CI pipeline to speed up runs.
- Implement more robust **Error Handling & UI Feedback**.
- Start integrating with a **Real Backend API** (replacing mocks).
- Implement **Routing & Navigation** (e.g., protected routes).
- Begin writing **Component Tests** for our UI components.
- Or, suggest another feature or improvement you have in mind!
